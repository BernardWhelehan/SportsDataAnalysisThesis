# SportsDataAnalysisThesis
Code used in Sports Data Analysis Thesis


This is code used in my MSc thesis in Software Design and Development, in which I processed, extracted and analysed spatio-temporal Premier League
data from the 2018/19 season. I looked at the factors effecting possession percentage and possession territories of Manchester City, Leicester City
and Huddersfield across a 210 game dataset. These factors were Game Location (Home or Away?) and the Quality of the Opponent (against Top 4 teams, 
Mid 4 teams and Bottom 4 teams).
